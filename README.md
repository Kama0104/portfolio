# portfolio

##Sam Kamali - final assignment

###brief description on how I created my web portfolio:
####Since this is my first web portfolio, I wanted to make it look simple and clean.
I used my Adobe XD mockup as a guide to design my web portfolio.

####I faced multiple challenges during this experience. I handled them with patience and testing without deleting untill realising what the problem was. One of the main challenges is making responsive website for every possible screen size. I'm hoping i would get better at it by practicing more and more.
I learned that there are so many resources and so many different things that i could apply on websites. These are some of the websites that i looked through over the semester:

- [codehim](https://www.codehim.com/)
- [designshack](https://designshack.net/)
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
